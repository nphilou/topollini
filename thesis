Intro:
TDA good in understanding structures/time-series
dynamical systems
interpretability
open source dev
help neuroscience
practical aspect
work on a real-world challenge
both finding useful features and add them to the library
in the more challenge part, link to ML models
benchmark TDA features

kw: topological data analysis, persistent homology, neuroscience, neural code,
spike train, machine learning

Probl√©matique : how can we use TDA to understand neural code
